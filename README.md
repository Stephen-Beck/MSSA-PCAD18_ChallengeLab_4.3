Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place. (Problem 344 in leetcode)
```
Example 1:
    Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
    Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
    Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
    Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
